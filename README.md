#Energy Calibration
Data was collected with a Coaxial HPGe detector with Co-60, Am-241, and Eu-152 sources.

A python script was written to conduct a two-point linear energy calibration using the 59.541 keV peak from 241Am and the 661.657 keV peak from 137Cs, to apply the linear calibration model to the 133Ba dataset, and quantify the difference between the calibrated peak locations and the expected peak locations based on the literature.
